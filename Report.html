<p style="font-size: 25px">Introduction</p>
CMP1130M required us to create a website whilst considering web standards and specifications, amongst other factors such as responsiveness and interactive design. The most recent web standards are based around the most recent languages and technology available, thus the website has been designed with said languages and technology to ensure proper use of the most recent web standards. The website includes a variety of different elements in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The use of these languages allows us to implement the most recent markup and presentation elements, and allows us to use scripting through JavaScript to add animations among other functions to improve the functionality of our websites.

<p style="font-size: 25px">Web Standards</p>

<p>Web standards is the term used to name a group of general rules and guidelines which set out how a website should ideally be designed. These rules and guidelines show you the correct elements and tags to use, how they should be used and how they should be set out. Using the correct standards has several benefits; lower maintenance costs, better search rankings, forward compatibility and faster loading times. Faster loading is achieved as a website with fewer errors will load faster in general, this also prevents situations occurring where, as in the old standards, the browser will be left to fill in some gaps, which could result in errors in the website content. The other three come from the use of separate languages. This improves the readability of the code for both the programs and the humans coding it, and simplifies it making it easier for search engines to find. Using current web standards will also mean the website will be more responsive over multiple devices, which contributes to a lower cost as there will only be one version to maintain.</p>

<div class="textDiv" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
<text style="font-size: 18px; color: azure;">
<p>Although the benefits seem great, there are still some drawbacks to the current web standards. One major drawback is that the current web standards use the most recent code available, therefore it is complex and to be used effectively the coder will have to be experienced with web development. The coder will also have to know how different browsers work, as all browsers may not support the current web standards. Another drawback would be design limitation, if everyone is following the web standards perfectly, many websites will use similar setups as one will be deemed more effective or efficient than others, leading to a lack of creativity.</p>

<text style="font-size: 18px; color: azure;">
<p style="font-size: 25px">Techniques Used and Challenges</p>
The main technique I used to ensure my website followed web standards to a good degree was to keep checking back to the w3c validation tool every so often. This displays any differences between your website and the current web standards and by using this I was able to ensure that my website had no major faults and was close to following the web standards perfectly.

<div class="textDiv" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
<text style="font-size: 18px; color: azure;">
<p>One of the main challenges I met when following the web standards was that while some code may work perfectly fine and display fine, it may be considered out of date by the current web standards, and therefore popped up as an error when I validated the web page. This resulted in having to find work arounds or having to restart a section of the website to ensure it was closer to meeting the standards. However, the biggest challenge I had was making the website responsive to different browser sizes. Almost everything added to the website initially broke upon resizing the browser which led to a lot of fiddling to get the elements to position and display correctly.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px">File Setup</p>
The setup of your files is incredibly important as it will make it much easier to access parts of your website both while linking it in code, and finding it in the file explorer. Therefore, I used a clear setup for my files ensuring everything was contained within one folder, but separated into different sections of: Assets, CSS3, JavaScript and HTML.

<text style="font-size: 18px; color: azure;">
<p style="font-size: 25px">Markup Structure</p>
The structure of your HTML, CSS and JS is also extremely important as it is how you, or someone else, will be updating your site in the future. Therefore, it is important that it is well spaced and easy to understand. In my code I made sure to space the code out, leaving gaps and going to the next line for a new tag. The JavaScript should also be commented as that is the most complex part of the code and will often be incredibly difficult to understand if it is not your own code. Classes should also be named relevant to what is contained within the element to aid in the understanding of your code.
